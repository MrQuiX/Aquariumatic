Write an updated Aquariumatic class to cater for the features of the all-in-one master unit.
The Pi will have a set or relays and sensors attached to them and act as the default tank (/tank1 on the webserver)
The functions in the class should always request the TankNo variable from the address; if it is tank1 then use 
onboard peripherals, if tank2+ then send a command via i2c to the appropriate slave device.

create a csv file for i2c addresses
This will allow us to map the i2c slave address against a tank number, or to denote serial is to be used.

Rewrite the Arduino slave code to respond to both serial (for attaching to a PC/single master unit).
- experiment with i2c screens for it. Can a software based i2c be used to allow the arduino to 
allow the screens to be kept off the main i2c line, with the arduino acting as the slave for it?
