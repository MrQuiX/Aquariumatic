To implement:

1. Complete i2c slave code
2. Switch lcd code for i2c lcd use
  Look to implementing Software i2c for one-way communication with the lcd:

3. Create a SoftwareSerial port for the expansion port - will connect to either a Bluetooth or ESP8266 module.
4. Adapt sketch to run incuding the Serial, SoftwareSerial and i2c functions:
  Listen for commands coming in from all three; Send all Serial returns to Serial and SoftwareSerial, and 
  send all i2c returns to i2c and SoftwareSerial
5. Make code compatible with various Arduinos
