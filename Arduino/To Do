Plan:

Temp/pH sensing
On setup the arduino will request the ranges form temp and pH levels from the Raspberry Pi over the i2c connection.
It will then monitor input from the pH and temp sensors, and send an alert to the Pi via 
i2c if the values step outside of the range.

Relays
The Pi will send commands to the Arduino to switch on the relays for the heaters, lights etc. These will come 
from either user button presses on the web interface, or automated calls in response to the above alerts.
