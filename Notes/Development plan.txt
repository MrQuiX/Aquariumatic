Hub
Continue to develop Python webserver for
Following individual modules planned for variants
-aquarium.py - websocket based data collection
-aquariumUSB.py - for use with first prototype, gathers data via USB serial connection
-aquarium-2c.py - backup protocol for non-wireless setups
-Hardware.py - to create an all-in-one unit based solely on the Pi (no slaves controllers)
-IoT.py - to pass collected data to sites such asd Thingspeak if connected to internet.
-config.py - add a python script to determine what modules are required and manage code in a modular way.


Slave controllers
Copy and tweak current slave sketch to work with new prototype (Uno, relay shield, i2c oled screen)
Have arduino send data via software serial every 5-10 seconds).

Create ESP8266 sketch to receive data from software serial and send on via websocket.
